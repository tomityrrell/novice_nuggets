Welcome to the first novice nugget!  

These are based on real production code at a large and reputable company.
Most likely it was written by someone very smart, but new to python,
without a handy local python expert to turn to.  So they just did what
they were certain would work, even though they likely suspected there
was a better way.  Your task is to find that way.
